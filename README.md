# 🚀 DecentraFund - A Simple Crowdfunding DApp

## 📌 Project Title
**DecentraFund – A Minimal Crowdfunding Smart Contract**

---

## 📝 Project Description
DecentraFund is a lightweight crowdfunding smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It allows creators to raise funds transparently from supporters without any middlemen.  
Contributors can send ETH to the campaign, and once the funding goal is reached, the project owner can safely withdraw the collected funds.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To empower creators and innovators globally by providing a **trustless**, **transparent**, and **decentralized** crowdfunding system that ensures fairness and autonomy through blockchain technology.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- 💸 **Decentralized Funding:** Contributors send ETH directly to the smart contract.  
- 🔒 **Goal-Based Withdrawal:** Funds can only be withdrawn once the target is reached.  
- 🧾 **Transparent Tracking:** Total funds raised are publicly visible on-chain.  

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- 🌐 Integration with a **React.js + Ethers.js frontend** for user-friendly interaction.  
- 💰 **Refund Mechanism** for contributors if the goal isn’t met.  
- 🪙 Support for **ERC20 tokens** (e.g., stablecoins).  
- 📱 Mobile DApp version for broader accessibility.  
- 🔍 On-chain analytics and contributor tracking dashboard.  

---

### 💡 Tech Stack
- **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (or any EVM-compatible chain)  
- **Tools:** Remix IDE / Hardhat / Foundry  

---

### 🧠 How to Use
1. Deploy the contract using **Remix IDE** or a **Hardhat script**.  
2. Set a goal amount (in wei) in the constructor during deployment.  
3. Contributors call the `contribute()` function and send ETH.  
4. Once the goal is met, the owner calls `withdraw()` to collect funds.
